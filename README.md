## Introduction

The Face Mask Detection project addresses the need for public safety by automating the detection of face masks in real-time. This project uses a pre-trained model for face detection and a custom classifier for mask detection, making it both efficient and effective.

---

## Features

- **Real-time Detection:** Detects faces and classifies whether they are wearing a mask or not.
- **Pre-trained Models:** Utilizes the SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) framework for face detection.
- **Customizable:** Easily replace or retrain the classification model for enhanced accuracy.
